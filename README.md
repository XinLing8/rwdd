# Quizzing You – Responsive Web Design and Development Project

## Project Overview

**"Quizzing You"** is a web-based English quiz platform designed specifically for primary school students aged 7 to 12. The platform provides an engaging and structured approach to language learning, offering various types of quizzes such as:
- Fill-in-the-Blank
- Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)
- Matching Words

Each quiz is tailored to different grade levels (1–6) and covers essential English language topics including:

- Verbs
- Vocabulary

The system supports student interactivity and allows for self-assessment through immediate feedback, promoting independent learning among young users.

## About This Project

This project was developed as a **group assignment** for the **Responsive Web Design and Development (RWDD)** course, part of the **Diploma in Information and Communication Technology with a Specialism in Software Engineering (Semester 4)** at **Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation (APU)**.

The assignment requires the development of a **fully functional and responsive web application** using:
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Client-side scripting)
- **PHP** (Server-side scripting)
